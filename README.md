1. https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. 
The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the 
island's right and bottom edges. The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You 
are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea 
level of the cell at coordinate (r, c). The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water 
can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's 
height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent 
to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can 
flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.


2. https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/

An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference
between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0


3. https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]


4. https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
